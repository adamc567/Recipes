    <h2>Why not? It takes less then two and a half hours. Have fun or just suffer through, but either way be mildly impressed.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 leg of lamb, deboned (look up a youtube or something)</li>
        <li>1 bunch of fresh rosemary, cleaned (like half an ounce)</li>
        <li>4 filets of spanish anchovie</li>
        <li>1 C good olive oil</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Butcher twine</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375fs</li>
        <li>Once the leg of lamb is deboned, remove access fat pockets and any visible silver skin</li>
        <li>In a food processor add rosemary and anchovies. Add just enough olive oil to allow the ingredients to form a paste.</li>
        <li>Add the rest of the olive oil</li>
        <li>Lay the lamb flat and season generously. Then rub with the oil mixture</li>
        <li>Roll the lamb tightly to form a log</li>
        <li>Use the twine to truss the lamb, maintaining a uniform log</li>
        <li>Season the outside generously then rub down with the oil</li>
        <li>Use a roasting pan with grate inserted to keep the lamb off the bottom of the pan</li>
        <li>Put lamb in the hot oven for about an hour and 45 minutes, until the internal tempature reads 130</li>
        <li>From here, you can rest for 10-20 minutes and slice and serve or cool it completely and slice steaks off of the roast and in a hot pan sear in some oil with a little garlic and herbs to finish</li>
    </ol>
